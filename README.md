</p>
<br />
Next we will make another example from Karen creating a ticket with less severity. This ticket will be a "General Inquiry" ticket about the updates on new equipment.

<br />
Now we will log on as an agent we've created back in the last lab (jane.doe) 
</p>
<br />

You can see once we have logged in, the tickets we've created as Karen or enduser will pop up.
